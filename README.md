The aim of this project is to create a machine learning model that helps analyze and track emails sent through Gmail-based marketing campaigns. This tool is designed to support small and medium-sized business owners in improving their email marketing strategies and boosting customer retention.

A major challenge in email marketing is figuring out which emails are being read, ignored, or acknowledged by recipients. By identifying the most engaging emails, business owners can tailor their marketing efforts more effectively, increasing their chances of success.

To address this issue, we will gather data on various email features, such as subject lines, sender names, content, format, and frequency. We will also consider the target audience and other important factors.

Using this data, we will train a machine learning model to predict whether an email is likely to be read, ignored, or acknowledged by the recipient. The model will be able to analyze new emails and forecast how they are likely to be received.
